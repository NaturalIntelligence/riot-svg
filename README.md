# riot-svg
Creating RIOT SVG transformable elements


The purpose of this project is to make riot based interactive SVG transformable elements which can be created with the help of JS or can be directly insterted into HTML. They can be individually used in any project. They can also be created with the help of mouse.


**Note**: Due to the issue with parent-child relationship in riot-js, I believe riot is not the good choice for this. I've moved to svj.js for imglab development.
